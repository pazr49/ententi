        A criminology student who had a "grievance against women" has been jailed for attacking two friends in a frenzied stabbing on a beach in Bournemouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nasen Saadi, 21, must serve a minimum of 39 years for the

          murder of Amie Gray
        </a>
        and attempted murder of Leanne Miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pair, who were aged 34 and 38 and not known to Saadi, were
        <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqlnpg0gr1o">
          attacked on Durley Chine Beach
        </a>
        last May.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saadi was described at Winchester Crown Court as a "social misfit" who committed his crimes "to feel powerful".

        Judge Mrs Justice Cutts told Saadi: "It seems you have felt humiliated and rejected for any advances you have made towards girls which has led over time to a deeply-suppressed rage towards society and women in particular."
      </p>
      <p>
        In remarks prepared for the sentencing hearing, Sarah Jones KC, prosecuting, said the murder was "premeditated" with the defendant's misogyny as a possible motive.
      </p>
      <p>
        She added there was "clear evidence" of Saadi's "difficulties with women and misogyny".
      </p>
      <p>
        The court also was told, in the absence of the jury, that Saadi had touched himself sexually in his prison cell before the trial after he asked a female prison officer how much publicity the case was getting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The criminology student at the University of Greenwich had collected knives and researched locations to carry out the killing, the court was told.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even asked course lecturers questions on how to get away with murder.

        The trial revealed Saadi had travelled from his home in Croydon to the Travelodge hotel in Bournemouth on 21 May.
      </p>
      <p>
        He scouted the area before moving to the Silver How Hotel on 23 May, and attacking his victims the following night.

        No weapon, clothing or DNA evidence was recovered during Dorset Police's investigation.

        It was also discovered that Saadi had an interest in true crime and was "fascinated" with knives, having bought six blades from websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        He used the name "Ninja Killer" on his Snapchat account and was found to have carried out searches about the Milly Dowler and Brianna Ghey killings.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of his lecturers, Dr Lisa-Maria Reiss, told the court Saadi had asked questions on "how to get away with murder", and she asked him: "You're not planning a murder are you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        During his trial, Sarah Jones KC, prosecuting, said: "This defendant seems to have wanted to know what it would be like to take life, perhaps he wanted to know what it would be like to make women feel afraid, perhaps he thought it would make him feel powerful, make him interesting to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Perhaps he just couldn't bear to see people engaged in a happy, normal social interaction and he decided to lash out, to hurt, to butcher."
